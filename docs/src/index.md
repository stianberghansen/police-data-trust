If you are interested in volunteering for our project:

- **Join the Slack.** Say hi and introduce yourself! Additionally, the `#police-data-trust` channel has various pinned items that will be of use for getting started.

- **Read the docs.** The docs contain more information about the project, plus steps on how to set up the project so you can start contributing.

- **Meet us on Tuesday nights.** We would love to meet you! We meet alongside other Code for Boston teams every Tuesday at 7:00pm. [Sign up to attend Code for Boston events here](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Boston/).
